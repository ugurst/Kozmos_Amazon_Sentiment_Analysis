Kozmos, which produces products focused on home textiles and daily wear and sells through Amazon, aims to increase its sales by analyzing the comments on its products and improving its features according to the complaints it receives. In line with this goal, the comments were labeled by sentiment analysis and a classification model was created with the labeled data.

The data set consists of variables indicating the comments made on a particular product group, the comment title, the number of stars, and how many people found the comment useful.
